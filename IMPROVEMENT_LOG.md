# Improvement log

Available counts use canonical scoreboard states, ordered as identity / people /
locations / financials / website / social / jobs / news/activity. A baseline's
before value is not measured. `checked/wrong` must describe its audit scope;
coverage alone is not a wrong-company check. Log every accepted or rolled-back
change against the same frozen cohort, preserving its scoreboard and state.

| Date | Commit | Feature ID | Change | Per-section available before → after | Website budget-exhausted companies | Wrong-company check (checked/wrong) | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| 2026-11-04 | `f409645` | BASELINE | Fixed 100-company benchmark; no production changes | not measured → 100/100/85/100/8/4/1/4 | 26 | 100 companies / 0 wrong-company claims (stored-source audit) | KEEP | Frozen reference; 100 envelopes, exit 0; coverage matches comparison D exactly. |
| 2026-11-04 | `ce486e0` | F1 | Separate absent speculative domains from known-source failures | 100/100/85/100/8/4/1/4 → 100/100/85/100/8/4/1/21 | 27 | 17 source items opened / 0 wrong | KEEP | No available-count drops; 692 tests passed; exact-company source review passed. |
| 2026-11-04 | `30976c6` | F8 | Keep complete registry facts available with separate website-news diagnostics | 100/100/85/100/8/4/1/21 → 100/100/85/100/8/4/1/30 | 26 | 9 source items opened / 0 wrong | KEEP | No available-count drops; 696 tests passed; exact-company source review passed. |
| 2026-11-04 | `9e5b7f0` | NAV-INACTIVE | Reconcile settled repeated-INACTIVE headers only with live closure proof | 100/100/85/100/8/4/1/30 → 100/100/85/100/8/4/1/30 | 26 | 1 source items opened / 0 wrong | KEEP | No available-count drops; 702 tests passed; exact-company source review passed. |

Baseline artifact: `bench/runs/20261103T183536297367Z-f409645/scoreboard.json` (ignored local run; retain or upload the run directory). Measured wall time 47.052 seconds, HTTP requests 610, latest-year accounts 100, deadline hits 0, warnings none. The earlier D run used 609 HTTP requests and 62.081 seconds; this live rerun made 256 website requests versus 255 because connection/redirect fallback outcomes changed. Registry requests stayed 302 and NAV requests stayed 52; no coverage or distinct-fact totals changed.

Counting parity was also verified directly against D's saved outputs for every canonical/exported state and distinct-fact total, not only the five headline counts. The existing offline audit examined 100 companies and 11,053 available claims: 10,983 correct, 0 incorrect, 70 unverifiable activity claims, and 0 wrong-company findings. This is agreement with stored sources, not fresh independent live verification. The output verifier passed membership, schemas, evidence and synthesis checks. GitHub Actions was not dispatched. The benchmark harness was clean at the recorded commit.

F1 evidence: `bench/runs/20261103T184623325670Z-ce486e0/` contains the scoreboard, raw source state, complete newly available item list and opened exact-company proofs in `newly-available-review.json`. Test count: 692.

F8 evidence: `bench/runs/20261103T185130143467Z-30976c6/` contains the scoreboard, raw source state, complete newly available item list and opened exact-company proofs in `newly-available-review.json`. Test count: 696.

NAV-INACTIVE evidence: `bench/runs/20261103T190201769481Z-9e5b7f0/` contains the scoreboard, raw source state, complete newly available item list and opened exact-company proofs in `newly-available-review.json`. Test count: 702.
